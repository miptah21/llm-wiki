# Antigravity AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
This repository is a comprehensive **Agentic Engineering Skills Library** — a curated collection of 119 specialized AI agent skills compatible with modern AI coding assistants (Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, etc.). Skills cover the full engineering stack: data engineering (dbt, Airflow, Snowflake), frontend (React, Next.js), financial analysis, document generation, DevOps, and more.

## Core Agent Behavior & Interaction
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Do not assume context. When interacting with this repository, always rely on the specialized skills stored in `.agents/skills/`. Read the `SKILL.md` of the relevant skill before executing complex tasks.
- **Methodology Coexistence:** Alternative development methodologies (e.g., Superpowers, Karpathy Guidelines) are allowed to coexist alongside default skills to offer flexibility. Keep overlapping skills cleanly separated in their respective directories and metadata categories (e.g., the dedicated `"superpowers"` category).
- **Modularity:** Treat agent skills as code. Maintain separation of concerns between deterministic tasks (e.g., executing Python scripts) and LLM-driven reasoning.
- **Shared Vocabulary:** Read `.agents/skills/CONTEXT.md` for domain terms, architecture context, and coding conventions.

## Phase 0 — Intent Gate (EVERY message)

Before doing anything, classify the request:

| Type | Signal | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Trivial** | Single file, known location, direct answer | Execute directly |
| **Explicit** | Specific file/line, clear command | Execute directly |
| **Exploratory** | "How does X work?", "Find Y" | Research first |
| **Open-ended** | "Improve", "Refactor", "Add feature" | Assess codebase first |
| **Ambiguous** | Unclear scope, multiple interpretations | Ask ONE clarifying question |

### Ambiguity Check

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Single valid interpretation | Proceed |
| Multiple interpretations, similar effort | Proceed with default, note assumption |
| Multiple interpretations, 2x+ effort difference | **MUST ask** |
| Missing critical info | **MUST ask** |
| User's design seems flawed | **MUST raise concern** before implementing |

## Executable Commands (with RTK Compression)
When analyzing the workspace, always prioritize the workspace's default high-level API tools (like `view_file`, `grep_search`, `list_dir`) over spawning raw shell commands, as they are pre-optimized and do not require user execution approval.
If a command must be executed in the terminal (due to lack of a high-level tool equivalent), you MUST prefix eligible commands with `rtk` to reduce token consumption by 60-90%:
- **Environment:** Use the local workspace configuration.
- **Python/ETL Tasks:** Use `rtk python <script.py>` or `rtk pytest`.
- **Global Compliance Audit:** Run `rtk python .agents/scripts/run_all_audits.py [target_dir]` to execute all compliance scripts in one sweep.
- **DAG Testing:** Always run `rtk python <dag_file.py>` before finalizing orchestration changes.
- **Git & Logs:** Use `rtk git status`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git log`. Use `rtk read` and `rtk grep` only when default API tools are unavailable or insufficient.

## Linter & Artifact Boundaries
- **Ignore Audit Reports:** Always ensure generated verification reports or compliance dashboards (like `audit_report.md`) are ignored by search, lint, and static analysis tools to avoid self-referential false positives.
- **Windows Encoding Safeguard:** Any Python validation, execution, or sweep script that outputs emojis or non-ASCII characters MUST reconfigure `sys.stdout` to UTF-8 to prevent Windows terminal execution crashes.
- **Compliance Bypass Comments:** Highly cohesive files or visual templates that intentionally exceed default limits (such as `SKILL.md` size constraints or raw text i18n checks) may use comments like `<!-- i18n-ignore -->`, `<!-- lint-ignore-file-size -->`, or `# lint-ignore-file-size` to skip linter warnings.

## Coding Style, Standards & Boundaries
> **Single source of truth:** See `.agents/skills/CONTEXT.md` for all coding conventions, architecture context, and "Don't Touch" boundaries.
> **Skill Size Constraints:** A `SKILL.md` file must rarely exceed 250 lines. Any exhaustive tables, advanced schemas, or dialect-specific references MUST be placed in a `references/` directory next to the skill and linked via a `> **Reference:**` block.

## Detailed Conventions
See `docs/` for in-depth guides:
- `docs/implementation-protocol.md` — Pre-impl checks, delegation, verification, failure recovery
- `docs/communication-style.md` — Agent communication standards (includes Caveman mode)
- `docs/rtk-optimization.md` — RTK command mapping reference
- `docs/comment-policy.md` — When comments are acceptable vs unacceptable

The following **skills** also act as foundational project conventions:
- `clean-code` — Pragmatic coding standards (SRP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI)
- `git-workflow` — Repository standards for commits, branches, and PRs
- `tdd` — Test-Driven Development lifecycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
- `git-guardrails-claude-code` — Safety conventions preventing destructive git operations
- `karpathy-guidelines` — Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes

### Methodology Selection Protocol
- **Standard Tasks (Trivial/Explicit):** Use lightweight default conventions (`clean-code`, `git-workflow`, `tdd`) to optimize token consumption and maintain high execution speed.
- **Complex Tasks (Open-ended/Architectural, >3 steps):** Activate the **Superpowers** methodology (`using-superpowers`) as the primary execution framework. Superpowers skills (Socratic brainstorming, structured planning, isolated worktrees, and systematic debugging) will override default workflows to ensure maximum code safety and rigorous verification.
- **Dynamic Escalation Protocol:** If a standard task fails verification checks/tests more than twice, requires changes across more than 3 files, or introduces unexpected architectural dependencies, the agent MUST immediately escalate to the **Superpowers** methodology.

## Hard Blocks (NEVER violate)

| Constraint | No Exceptions |
|------------|---------------|
| Hardcode secrets or credentials | Never — use env vars or secret managers |
| Execute destructive SQL (`DROP`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`) without human approval | Never |
| Speculate about unread code | Never — read it first |
| Leave code in broken state after failures | Never |
| Commit without explicit user request | Never |

## Skills
Skills are in `.agents/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with trigger descriptions.
- **Full categorized index:** Read `.agents/skills/README.md`

### Quick Routing
When asked to perform a task, match it to the right category:

#### ⚡ Wiki Operations (HIGHEST PRIORITY — match these FIRST)
When the user's message starts with `chat`, `/chat`, `query`, `/query`, `ingest`, `/ingest`, `lint`, or `/lint`:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `chat <question>` or `/chat <question>` | Run `rtk python scripts/search.py --chat "<question>"`. If exit code 2: use the printed `AGENT_RAG_CONTEXT` to answer the question yourself, grounded in wiki content. **NEVER answer from general knowledge without searching first.** |
| `query <keywords>` or `/query <keywords>` | Run `rtk python scripts/search.py "<keywords>"` and display results |
| `ingest <file>` or `/ingest <file>` | Follow `WIKI_SCHEMA.md` §3.1 Ingest Protocol |
| `lint` or `/lint` | Run `rtk python scripts/linter.py` |

> **Full protocol details**: Read `.agents/skills/obsidian-vault/SKILL.md` for the complete Chat Protocol including Agent RAG Fallback instructions.
> **Page schemas & cross-reference rules**: Read `WIKI_SCHEMA.md` at project root.

**Chat Protocol (self-contained — NO skill loading required):**

1. **Run**: `rtk python scripts/search.py --chat "<question>"`
2. **If the script prints `=== COGNITIVE CHAT RESPONSE ===`**: Display that response to the user. Done.
3. **If exit code 2 (prints `AGENT_RAG_CONTEXT_START` ... `AGENT_RAG_CONTEXT_END`)**: The script found wiki context but has no LLM API key. **YOU** must answer using the printed context:
   - Respond in the **same language** as the user's question
   - **Ground** your answer in the wiki context — distinguish vault facts from general knowledge
   - **Preserve** scientific terms and LaTeX notation (do NOT translate them)
   - Do **NOT** include meta-summaries ("Work Summary" / "Ringkasan Pekerjaan")
   - **Always end** with a References (or Referensi) section containing a minimalist, clean bulleted list of standard Markdown links (no double brackets `[[` or `]]`) of the vault documents utilized:
     ```
     ## Referensi
     - Alec Radford et al. (2019) — [source-document-1](path)
     - Deskripsi singkat atau bidang/kategori — [concept-document-2](path)
     ```
4. **If 0 results**: Tell the user no relevant pages exist in the wiki for this topic.
